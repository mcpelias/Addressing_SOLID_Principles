SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. This principle is important because it promotes modular and maintainable code by ensuring that each class is responsible for only one aspect of the system's functionality.

In my example, I apply SRP by designing classes that have clear and focused responsibilities. For example, our User class is responsible for managing user data, while the EmailService class handles the task of sending emails. This separation of concerns makes our codebase easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The OCP suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by allowing new features to be added through extension rather than modification of existing code.

In my example, I adhere to the OCP by designing our components in a way that allows for easy extension without modifying existing code. For example, our Shape hierarchy allows for the addition of new shapes such as Rectangle and Circle without the need to modify the AreaCalculator component.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-designed and that polymorphism is correctly implemented.

In my example, I follow the LSP by ensuring that subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without altering the desirable properties of the program. For example, our Rectangle and Square components both inherit from the Shape component and behave consistently when used interchangeably.

Conclusion
In summary, the SOLID principles play a crucial role in shaping the design and architecture of our project. By adhering to these principles, we strive to create code that is modular, maintainable, and extensible, ultimately leading to better software quality and developer productivity.
